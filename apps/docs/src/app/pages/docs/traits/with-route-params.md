# withRouteParams

> **Deprecated:** Use [withRoute](./with-route) instead, which also supports `queryParams`.

This store feature provides access to the route params. The mapParams receives the route params object, use it to transform it
to an object, this will create a computed for each prop return by the mapParams function

**Usage Notes:** The store to be provided in a routed component, since this feature consumes from Angular's ActivatedRoute. 
Providing it in root or in a route-level factory is not sufficient.

## Examples
### Transform url params into store props
```typescript
// example route  /products/:id/
const ProductDetailStore = signalStore(
  withRouteParams(({ id }) => ({ id })),
  withCalls(() => ({
    loadProductDetail: (id: string) =>
      inject(ProductService).getProductDetail(id),
  })),
  withHooks(({ loadProductDetail, id }) => ({
    onInit: () => {
      loadProductDetail(id());
    },
  })),
);
```
