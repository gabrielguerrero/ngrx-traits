/**
 * This store feature allows access to the store's state, methods, computed signals, to store features that don't have a config factory that
 * can access the store. This can be useful for creating store features that need to access the store's state, methods, computed signals, etc. or to wrap store
 * features that don't have a config factory that can access the store.
 * @param featureFactory
 *
 * @example
 * // Use case 1: allow a custome store feature that receives a plain config object to access the store's state, methods, computed signals.
 * function withCustomFeature(config: { fooValue: string }) {
 * ...// create a custom store feature
 * }
 * const Store = signalStore(
 *       withState({ foo: 'foo' }),
 *       // ðŸ‘‡use previous state to configure custom feature
 *       withFeatureFactory(({ foo }) => withCustomFeature({ fooV: foo() })),
 *       // you can also use a signalStoreFeature inside withFeatureFactory
 *       withFeatureFactory(({ foo }) =>
 *         signalStoreFeature(
 *           withState({ foo2: foo() }),
 *           // ... other store features,
 *         ),
 *       ),
 *     );
 *
 * // Use case 2: use withFeatureFactory inside a custom feature to create a store whose config can be a factory that receives the store
 *   function withCustomFeature2<Input extends SignalStoreFeatureResult>(
 *       configFactory: FeatureConfigFactory<Input, { foo: string }>,
 *     ): SignalStoreFeature<
 *       Input,
 *       {
 *         state: { foo: string };
 *         computed: { bar: Signal<string> };
 *         methods: { baz: () => number };
 *       }
 *     > {
 *       return withFeatureFactory((store: StoreSource<Input>) => {
 *         const config = getFeatureConfig(configFactory, store);
 *         return signalStoreFeature(
 *           withState<{ foo: string }>({ foo: config.fooValue }),
 *           withComputed(({ foo }) => ({ bar: computed(() => foo() + 1) })),
 *           withMethods(({ foo, bar }) => ({
 *             baz: () => foo() + bar() + 2,
 *           })),
 *         );
 *       }) as any;
 *     }
 *
 *     // now withCustomFeature2 can be used like :
 *     const Store = signalStore(
 *       // withCustomFeature2({ fooValue: 'foo' }), // usual way with a plain object
 *       withState({ fooValue: 'foo' }),
 *       // or with a factory that receives the store
 *       withCustomFeature2(({ fooValue }) => ({ fooValue: fooValue() })),
 *     );
