/**
 * @experimental
 * Adds an event handler to the store, allowing the store to listen to events and react to them.
 * This helps with the communications between different store feature functions, normally a store feature can only
 * call methods generated by other store featured if it is declared before. With event handlers, you can send events
 * to other store features, and they can react to them regardless of the order of declaration. This is useful for example between
 * the filter and pagination store features, filter fires an event when the filter is changed and the pagination store
 * feature can listen to it and reset the current page back to 0, by using  withEventHandler pagination avoids creating a dependency
 * on the filter store feature, and the order in which they get declared won't affect the communication .
 *
 * @param eventHandlerFactory
 *
 * @example
 *
 *     const increment = createEvent('[Counter] Increment');
 *     const decrement = createEvent('[Counter] Decrement');
 *     const add = createEvent('[Counter] Add', props<{ value: number }>());
 *     const Store = signalStore(
 *       withState({ count: 0 }),
 *       withEventHandler((state) => [
 *         onEvent(increment, () => {
 *           patchState(state, { count: state.count() + 1 });
 *         }),
 *         onEvent(decrement, () => {
 *           patchState(state, { count: state.count() - 1 });
 *         }),
 *       ]),
 *       withMethods((state) => {
 *         return {
 *           // this test we can send events to things defined after this method
 *           add5: () => broadcast(state, add({ value: 5 })),
